# K3d

Learning kubernetes by using its small variant k3d.

## Description

k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.
k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to be able to use k3d at all
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) to interact with the Kubernetes cluster

### Installing

```
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | bash
```
